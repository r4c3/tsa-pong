# tsa-pong
HCHS TSA Pong is a retro pong game created specifically for Harris County High School's Technology Student Association chapter. The game's sprites and audio assets are a blend of references to Minecraft, Kirby, MF DOOM, and our chapter in general. A maximum of two players battle in each other in a best-of-four match.
